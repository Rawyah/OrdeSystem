# OrdeSystem 
*** PLEASE READ THIS ***
This is my Database assignment. 
It's and order app for a pizza resturant.
I included the database i made for the application.
The manager class is not fully finished, 
Therefore I will explain the application. 
The first window is welcome window where you can check your order if you already ordered, by typing your order number in the textfield and cicking "check order".
Click "new order" to go to another window to order. MUST click SUM UP first before ORDER then you will be given your order number. 
Back at the welcome window the last button is "go to manager", where the resturant manager can enter to send finshed orders by setting the food_ready column to the date and time the order is done. Sadly the buttons for it are not implemnted yet.
The application is comepletly functional and works perfectly.
